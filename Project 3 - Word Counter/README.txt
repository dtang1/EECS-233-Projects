Objective:
To design and implement a method to find the frequency of unique words in a given body of text. It should read an input file and print every unique word along with their number of occurrences in the document. A hashtable using separate chaining is used to keep track of current frequencies while scanning through text. Note, java's hashCode function is used to hash words into table.
