Objective:
To design and implement an abstract data type NumList that can be used to represent sequences of double precision floating-point numbers. NumList is implemented in NumArrayList, in which an array is used to store the sequence, and NumLinkedList, in which a singly linked list stores the sequence. Note built-in Java classes are not permitted.
