Objective:
To implement and study heapsort, quicksort, and mergesort. Each takes an integer array and sorts the array in increasing order and returns the execution time of the corresponding algorithm. Note, mergesort is implemented using bottom up approach. All three sorts are to be used on sorted, reveresed, and random arrays of variable lengths. Results are written in an excel spreadsheet.
